		<h2>The Society for Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math wishes you a happy Ada Lovelace Day. </h2>
		<p>Ada Lovelace, daughter of romantic poet Lord Byron, was the first computer programmer,<br> 
		designing an algorithm for Charles Babbage's hypothetical Analytical Engine in 1842. <br>
		Her work would later influence Alan Turing as he worked on the fundamentals of modern<br>
		computing a century later.</p><br>
		
		<strong>We are hosting a lunchtime seminar called</strong><br>
		
		<h2>"Geeking out: Women Passionate about Computer Science."</h2> <br>
		<strong>Today from 12pm-1pm in Merion room 174 in honor of Ada.
